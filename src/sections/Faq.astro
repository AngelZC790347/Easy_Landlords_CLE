                        How much do your services cost?

                        The answer is "it depends". On what? How much your home
                        will rent for (which we can help you determine), what
                        services you want and the number of properties you have.

                        Is hiring a property management company worth it?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text-primary-500">
                        The honest truth is, maybe not for everyone. We never
                        want to talk someone into a situation that isn't a good
                        fit for their circumstances. Homeowners who do choose to
                        work with us benefit from financially healthy rentals,
                        tenants who take care of their property, and freedom
                        from the day-to-day management of their home. Give us a
                        call and we can walk through the numbers together to
                        determine if we're a good fit for you.

                        How do you handle late rent payments?

                    <p class="text-primary-500">
                        We have a strict but fair rent collection policy. Rent
                        is due on the 1st of each month, with a grace period
                        until the 3rd. On the 4th, we begin assessing late fees
                        as outlined in the lease agreement. We send automated
                        reminders to tenants and follow up with personal contact
                        if payment isn't received. If necessary, we'll begin the
                        eviction process according to local laws. Our goal is to
                        maintain consistent cash flow while maintaining positive
                        landlord-tenant relationships.

                        Can I use Windster in open-source projects?
                    </h3>

                        Generally, it is accepted to use Windster in open-source
                        projects, as long as it is not a UI library, a theme, a
                        template, a page-builder that would be considered as an
                        alternative to Windster itself.

                        With that being said, feel free to use this design kit
                        for your open-source projects.
